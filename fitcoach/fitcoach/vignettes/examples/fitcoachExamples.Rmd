```

## Example 1 : Daily File Analysis

Examples below demonstrate usahe scenarios for FitAnalyzer

```{r cars}
library(fitcoach)
masterPath <- system.file ("extdata", 
                           "daily-time-series", 
                           package = "fitcoach")


ana <- FitAnalyzer$new ("calories")
timeseries.frame  <- ana$getAnalysisFrame (folder = masterPath, 
                             analysis.type = "daily")


```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
